Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the smaller or larger of two values.

Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array.

You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.
